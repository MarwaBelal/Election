The election process:
1. There are C candidates (numbered from 1 to C), and V voters.
2. The election process consists of up to 2 rounds. All candidates compete in the first round. 
If a candidate receives more than 50% of the votes, he wins, otherwise another round takes
place, in which only the top 2 candidates compete for the presidency, the candidate who
receives more votes than his opponent wins and becomes the new president.
3. The voters' preferences are the same in both rounds so if the preference list [1 2 3 4 5] in
the first round and the second round become between candidate 1 and 2 so the
preferences is the same [1 2].
